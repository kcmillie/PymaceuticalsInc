# Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
# Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
# Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
# Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.

# Analysis

# Observed Trend 1 - Total Volume Change & % Volume Change
# Over the 45 day treatment, Capomulin was the only treatment that showed the total volume decreasing.   
# The total volume of the cancer for Infubinol, Ketapril and Placebo increased over the 45 day treatment.
# These two observations can be seen in both the total volume plot and the %Volume change bar plot.  

# Observed Trend 2 - # of Metastatic Sites
# The number of metastic sites increased over the 45 days for all 4 drugs.  Capomulin had the largest increase in
# total number of metastatic sites. 

# Observed Trend 3 - Survival 
# Over the 45 day treatment, Capomulin had the highest survival rate compared to the other three treatments.  The 
# survival rate for the other 3 drugs over the 45 day treatment followed a similar decreasing trend.
